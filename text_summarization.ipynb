The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in front \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

      "Speech:The speech is the departing address of A P J Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, after completing his five-year term at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences, highlighting 10 important messages that he learned during his tenure. These messages include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Fostering agricultural growth\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems through partnership and courage\n",
      "6. Harnessing connectivity for societal transformation\n",
      "7. Defending the nation with pride\n",
      "8. Promoting a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He specifically recalls a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India cannot become a developed nation before 2020, and he appreciates her thoughtfulness. The speech is a reflection on his time in office and a call to action for the people of India to work together towards a brighter future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, assured the person that their dream would be taken seriously, and promised to take it to the highest national institution and work on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed and prosperous country. The speaker shares their experience of visiting a village in Nagaland, where they saw the positive impact of empowering village councils with financial powers and decision-making authority. They highlight the need for physical connectivity, such as quality roads, to enable villages to access markets and drive economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also discusses the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has established a \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) complex, connecting 65 villages and providing access to healthcare, education, and vocational training. This initiative has led to large-scale employment generation and entrepreneurship, demonstrating the potential for rural areas to drive economic growth and competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech is the importance of empowering villages and providing them with the necessary connectivity and resources to drive development and prosperity, in order to create a better future for India's youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the success of a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the support of self-help groups. The project has developed waste land into cultivable land, promoted sustainable economic development, and enabled the production of internationally competitive products with the help of experts from Japan. The speaker suggests that this model can be replicated to bridge the rural-urban divide, estimating that 7000 similar projects are needed across the country to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two inspiring experiences. The first is about meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan and showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker notes that to double agricultural production with limited resources, the nation must empower farmers and adopt a \"seed to food\" principle. The speaker is confident that through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries, the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about meeting a person named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs but has a positive and radiant personality. Despite his physical limitations, he is confident and grateful for the support he has received, and he asks the speaker to allow him to sing, indicating that he has overcome his challenges and is eager to share his talent. The speaker's encounters with the farmers and Krishna Murthy inspire a message of resilience and determination to \"defeat the problems and succeed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories of overcoming challenges. The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his limitations, has blossomed into a talented musician with the support of his family, teachers, and others. His positive attitude and perseverance have enabled him to share his gift with others, including performing at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were recovering from a devastating earthquake in 2005. The speaker visited the village and was impressed by the courage and resilience of the people, who had become \"masters of their problems\" rather than being controlled by them. The speech emphasizes the importance of partnership, positive attitude, and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker describes visiting a village after an earthquake and witnessing the bravery and smiles of the children and villagers as they participated in relief operations with the Armed Forces. The speaker also shares an experience from 2005, where they visited the Car Nicobar Islands after the Tsunami and were touched by the unique trait of the islanders, who took in affected victims as their own children. The speaker composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" to express their admiration for the islanders' courage, which was sung by the villagers. The speech also mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament, but the summary is cut off before the details of that event are shared. Overall, the speech highlights the importance of courage and community in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project to connect 53 African countries via satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks. The project aims to link:\n",
      "\n",
      "* 12 universities (7 in India, 5 in Africa)\n",
      "* 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 in India, 5 in Africa)\n",
      "* 53 tele-medicine centers\n",
      "* 53 tele-education centers\n",
      "\n",
      "A pilot project has already been launched in Ethiopia, with the Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students, and specialists from CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses several topics, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. India's technological collaboration with Africa: The speaker mentions that Hyderabad is providing tele-consultation services to a hospital in Addis Ababa, and that India's experience in using technology for societal benefit is being shared with Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. National pride and defense: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, having visited the Siachen Glacier, gone on an underwater journey, and flown in a fighter jet. They praise the bravery and dedication of India's soldiers, sailors, and air warriors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Interaction with defense and security personnel: The speaker mentions interacting with members of the defense forces, paramilitary forces, and police personnel, acknowledging their contributions to national security.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Youth movement for a developed India: The speaker briefly mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech highlights India's international collaborations, national pride, and the importance of defense and security, as well as the potential of the country's youth to drive development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. It highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker shares examples of the positive impact of this training, including increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker believes that empowering the 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's progress. The speech concludes by emphasizing the richness of India's tradition and the efforts being made by various agencies to promote cultural diversity and unity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth. The speech highlights the need for empowerment and equal access to resources, education, and opportunities. The speaker outlines a vision for a developed India with five key characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable distribution of energy and water\n",
      "3. Harmonious collaboration between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Access to education with a value system, regardless of socio-economic background\n",
      "5. A hub for talented scholars, scientists, and investors\n",
